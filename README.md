# Stock Analysis based on Year

## Overview
This project is meant to analyze and display the total daily volume and overall return for 12 stocks for the years of 2017 or 2018. The project allows the user to input on which year they want to see the anaysis run.
## Results
After running the analysis on both years for all 12 stocks we can draw a few of conclusions regarding the stock performance. First, 2017 was a strong return year for a majority of the stocks analyzed, with four stocks exceeding 100% return (see table below).

Second, in 2018 there was a substantial downturn in stock returns, with all but 2 taking a loss of returns. This perhaps suggests some kind of event that affected these particular stocks (see table below)

Third, only 2 stocks maintained returns for both years (ENPH and RUN), with RUN increasing its return in 2018 beyond its 2017 return. Further, they both increased their daily volume by double. Whatever caused the other 10 stock returns to drop seems to have left these 2 unaffected, and suggests they are perhaps more immune to market volatility. 

I would suggest more data be gathered on the performance of these 12 stocks for a greater range of years. This would give a clearer picture of long-term performance to ensure greater liklihood of returns over time, as well as help us understand what caused the downturn in the market. Furthermore, I would suggest more data for RUN and ENPH specifically to understand what causal factors contributed both to their stability relative to the other stocks, as well as their increased volume. An initial glance at this data shows these two could perhaps be good candidates for invesetment. 

Regarding the script utilized to run this analysis, using a refactored script drastically cut the runtimes for the stock analysis. While
