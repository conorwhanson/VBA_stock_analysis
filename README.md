# Stock Analysis based on Year

## Overview
This project is meant to analyze and display the total daily volume and overall return for 12 stocks for the years of 2017 or 2018. The project allows the user to input on which year they want to see the anaysis run.
## Results
After running the analysis on both years for all 12 stocks we can draw a few of conclusions regarding the stock performance. First, 2017 was a strong return year for a majority of the stocks analyzed, with four stocks exceeding 100% return. Second, in 2018 there was a substantial downturn in the stock returns, with all but 2 taking a loss of returns. This perhaps suggests some kind of event that affected these particular stocks. Third, only 2 stocks maintained returns for both years (ENPH and RUN), with RUN jumping in return in 2018 beyond its 2017 return. Whatever caused the other 10 stock returns to drop seems to have left these 2 unaffected, and this suggests they are more immune to market volatility.
